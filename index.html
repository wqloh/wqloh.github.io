    Each tag does something different. For example:
        - The <html> tag defines the whole document.
        - The <h1> tag defines a large heading
        - The <p> tag defines a paragraph
        - Tags appear as an opening <div> and closing </div> pair

    <!-- The head tag links to resources our page needs and defines information about it. Tags in the <head> aren't displayed on the page. -->

        Welcome! In the sections below, you'll find a diverse range of graphs about the ðŸŒŽ

    <!-- We're organising the page into sections, with each section containing a chart, title and a description -->

            <h2>Section 1: GDP & Life Expectancy</h2>
            <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
                Life expectancy has a strong linear correlation with GDP per capita across all continents. Many African countries have low life expectancy and low GDP per capita, while many European countries have high life expectancy and high GDP per capita.

            <h2>Section 2: Declining Populations</h2>
            <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
                The populations of many advanced economies around the world are projected to decline in the coming decades leading up to 2100. They are projected to experience either decreasing rates of population increase or even population decrease altogether.

            <h2>Section 3: Olympics Rep</h2>
            <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
                The ratio of the number of athletes who participated in the 2024 Paris Olympics to the population of each country varies greatly across countries. Countries like Pakistan and Myanmar have disproportionately few athletes for their large population sizes relative to the rest of the world.

            <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
                A common gripe of consumers in the UK, but compared with the rest of Europe, a VAT of 20% turns out to be pretty standard. Interesting outliers include Hungary at 27% and Switzerland at 8.1%.
